[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2997/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2997)

Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.

Learn more details about the pipeline on [AliceVision website](http://alicevision.github.io).

See [results of the pipeline on sketchfab](http://sketchfab.com/AliceVision).

## Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.
It infers the geometry of a scene from a set of unordered photographs or videos.
Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, losing depth information.
The goal of photogrammetry is to reverse this process.

See the [presentation of the pipeline steps](http://alicevision.github.io/#photogrammetry).

## License

The project is released under MPLv2, see [**COPYING.md**](COPYING.md).


## Get the project

See [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md) to setup the project and pre-requisites.

Get the source code and install runtime requirements:
```bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/alicevision/meshroom
cd meshroom
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Start Meshroom

You need to have [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) installation in your PATH (and LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux/macOS).

 - __Launch the User Interface__

```bash
# Windows
set PYTHONPATH=%CD% && python meshroom/ui
# Linux/macOS
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python meshroom/ui
```

On Ubuntu, you may have conflicts between native drivers and mesa drivers. In that case, you need to force usage of native drivers by adding them to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-340 PYTHONPATH=$PWD python meshroom/ui`
You may need to adjust the folder `/usr/lib/nvidia-340` with the correct driver version.

 - __Launch a 3D reconstruction in command line__

```bash
# Windows: set PYTHONPATH=%CD% &&
# Linux/macOS: PYTHONPATH=$PWD
python bin/meshroom_batch --input INPUT_IMAGES_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

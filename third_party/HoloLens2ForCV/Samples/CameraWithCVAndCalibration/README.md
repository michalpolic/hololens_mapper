# Camera with CV and calibration sample

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

The sample is a Holographic UWP application that demonstrates uses OpenCV to detect arUco markers in the two frontal gray-scale cameras and triangulate the detections. Coordinate frames for sensors are rendered relative to the rig coordinate frame. The application is built using a [DX11 template app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/creating-a-holographic-directx-project). The app adds a `CalibrationProjectionVisualizationScenario` class that manages and initializes sensors and creates DX rendering models for the app. It replaces the single spinning cube from the template with multiple models used to show triangulation and aruco detection visualizations. `OpenCvInstallArm64-412d` contains an arm64 header and library distribution of Opencv. These require git lfs. `One-Arruco-markers-DICT_6X6_250.pdf` is the aruco marker recognized by the app.

## Prerequisites

* Install the [latest Mixed Reality tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools)

## Setup

1. Open the **CameraWithCVAndCalibration.sln** file in Visual Studio, build (ARM64), and deploy
2. [Enable Device Portal and Research Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/research-mode)

## Running the sample

1. Run from the debugger in Visual Studio by pressing F5
2. The app will show up in the start menu in HoloLens
